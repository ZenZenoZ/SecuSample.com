        <h1>Signs of a Secure Website</h1>
    </header>
    <br><hr><hr>
<div class="content-lesson">
    <section class="lessons">
        <div class="lesson">
            <h2>Look for the S in HTTPS</h2>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Many URLs begin with “https” instead of http, this shows that they are secure because they have an SSL certificate. This protects information entered into the site, whereas websites with http are easily accessible, and are the information is more easily stolen.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="lesson">
            <h2>Check for a Website Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Many websites have one and this demonstrates that this website is aware and actively complying with laws that provide security.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="lesson">
            <h2>Find Their Contact Information</h2>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If the website provides contact information, such as an email or social media account, it does not guarantee security, but they demonstrate that the website can provide you with assistance if need be.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="lesson">
            <h2>Verify Their Trust Seal</h2>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If you see a sign like “verified” or “secure” it is likely a trust seal, which indicates the website has a security partner. This can also indicate that the website scans for malware. To make sure it is authentic if you click the badge then it should take you to a verification page.</p>
        </div>

        <h1>Know the Signs of Website Malware</h1>
        <div>
            <h2>Defacements</h2>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Defacements are a type of cyber attack where the attacker replaces the legitimate content of a website with their own content, often for ideological or political reasons. This can include replacing the homepage with a message, image, or video that promotes their own views or agenda. Defacements can be used to spread propaganda, promote hacktivism, or simply to vandalize a website for fun.</p>
            <h2>Suspicious pop ups</h2>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suspicious pop-ups are messages that appear unexpectedly on your screen while browsing the web. They can contain claims that are designed to scare or entice users into clicking on them, which can lead to the accidental download of malware. It's important to be cautious when encountering these types of pop-ups and avoid clicking on them whenever possible.</p>
            <h2>Malvertising</h2>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some malicious ads are easy to catch. They typically appear unprofessional, contain spelling/grammar errors, promote “miracle” cures or celebrity scandals, or feature products that don’t match your browsing history. It’s important to note that legitimate ads can be impacted by malware,, so exercise caution when clicking.</p>
            <h2>Phishing kits</h2>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Phishing kits are fraudulent websites designed to look like legitimate sites, such as banking or payment portals. They are created with the intention of tricking users into entering sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details. These kits often contain spelling and grammar errors, which can be a sign that the site is not legitimate. It's important to be cautious when entering sensitive information online and to ensure that the website is authentic before proceeding.</p>
            <h2>Malicious redirects</h2>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If you type in a URL and are redirected to another site – especially one that looks suspicious – you have been affected by a malicious redirect. They are often used in conjunction with phishing kits.</p>
            <h2>SEO spam</h2>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;SEO spam, also known as comment spam or black-hat SEO, is a technique used to manipulate search engine rankings by creating unnatural links to a website. This is often done by adding spammy links to the comments section of blogs, forums, or other websites.</p>
            <h2>Search engine warnings</h2>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Search engines like Google and Bing have security scanning functionality that can detect malware on a website. If a website is found to be infected with malware, the search engine may display a warning to users who try to access the site. For example, Google may display a "Deceptive site ahead" or "This site may harm your computer" warning. Bing may display a "This site might contain threats" warning. These warnings can have a negative impact on the website's traffic and reputation, so it's important to address any security issues as soon as possible.</p>
